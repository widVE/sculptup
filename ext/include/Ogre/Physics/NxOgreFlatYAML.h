/*! class. FlatYAML
    
    desc.
    
     Collection of functions to serialise a property list to a Simplified YAML file format.
    
     This only partially complies with the YAML specification, Flat YAML is only concerned with
     the key-value part of YAML, so other features are missing or incomplete.
     
     More specifically:
      * The YAML document is treated as a flat continuous structure, with no support for child values.
      * All keys are assumed to be strings.
      * Lists are not supported.
      * FlatYAML uses the "Value" class as an intermediate, so accepted types of values are:
         - null
         - string (without newline characters)
         - float
         - integer
         - boolean
         - Vec3 (as a custom nxogre/vec3 type)
         - Quat (as a custom nxogre/quat type)
         - Other types are assumed to be strings.
