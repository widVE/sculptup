          while internal cloth constraints (i.e. bending & stretching) are being resolved.

          The reverse holds for smaller dominanceWeights.

           After this call, the cloth is infinitely stiff between collisions and simply 
           moves with the actor. At impacts with an impact impulse greater than impulseThreshold, 
           the cloth is plastically deformed. Thus, a cloth with a core behaves like a piece of metal.
           
           p. The core actor's geometry is adjusted automatically. Its size also depends on the 
           cloth thickness. Thus, it is recommended to choose small values for the thickness.
           At impacts, colliding objects are moved closer to the cloth by the value provided in 
           penetrationDepth which causes a more dramatic collision result.
           
           p. The core actor must have at least one shape, and currently supported shapes are 
           spheres, capsules, boxes and compounds of spheres.
           It is recommended to specify the density rather than the mass of the core body. 
           This way the mass and inertia tensor are updated when the core deforms.
           
           p. The maximal deviation of cloth particles from their initial positions
           (modulo the global rigid body transforms translation and rotation) can be
           specified via the parameter maxDeformationDistance. Setting this parameter to
