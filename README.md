<em><strong>Description: </em></strong> SculptUp runs in a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment. Users interact with the virtual environment through a handheld wand and voice recognition. There are two unique states of manipulation that the user switches between: sculpt mode and world mode. In sculpt mode, the user can create and modify volumetric material, modeled as isosurfaces, using a minimalist control scheme. This control scheme allows the user to make highly detailed objects by arbitrarily adding, subtracting, and painting isosurfaces similarly to how a user would sculpt a clay model in reality. User’s can also change paint and volumetric colors through a speech-based interface. In world mode, the user operates in an OGRE scene, where he or she can use their detailed volumetric models to design the salient features of a large-scale scene. All of this work can be exported from the SculptUp system into a rendering environment for the production of high quality images. Ultimately, SculptUp’s interface substantially expedites the creative process and catalyzes rapid scene prototyping.

The distinct models shown above have each been generated under five minutes in the Scupltup program and then later rendered in Maya.

Here is an example of a farm scene that has also been built in Sculptup and soon rendered in Maya.
