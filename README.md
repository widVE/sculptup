# Sculptup

![Alt text](T:\sculptup README img.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

<em><strong>Description: </em></strong> SculptUp runs in a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment. Users interact with the virtual environment through a handheld wand and voice recognition. There are two unique states of manipulation that the user switches between: sculpt mode and world mode. In sculpt mode, the user can create and modify volumetric material, modeled as isosurfaces, using a minimalist control scheme. This control scheme allows the user to make highly detailed objects by arbitrarily adding, subtracting, and painting isosurfaces similarly to how a user would sculpt a clay model in reality. User’s can also change paint and volumetric colors through a speech-based interface. In world mode, the user operates in an OGRE scene, where he or she can use their detailed volumetric models to design the salient features of a large-scale scene. All of this work can be exported from the SculptUp system into a rendering environment for the production of high quality images. Ultimately, SculptUp’s interface substantially expedites the creative process and catalyzes rapid scene prototyping.
